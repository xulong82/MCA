##### This document describes methods to identify matching patterns in multiple datasets. 

```{r, include = F}

library(ape)
library(amap)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape)
library(ggplot2)
library(genefilter)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(WGCNA)

```

NCI60 and Immgen datasets are suitable datasets for testing. NCI60 include transcriptome and proteomic results of 59 cancer cell lines. Immgen includes transcriptome of 244 well-defined immulogical cell types. Immgen data was used in this particular analysis.

```{r}
setwd("~/Dropbox/GitHub/MCA")
load("nci60.rdt")
load("../Lupus/Immgen/immgenList.rdt") # version:20150811
immgen <- immgenList$immgen # 224 transcriptome

str(nci60)
dim(immgen)

```
